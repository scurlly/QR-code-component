## My process

I began by analyzing the challenge requirements and breaking down the component into smaller parts. Then, I referred to the design png provided for the design.

Next, I started coding the HTML markup for the component, followed by the CSS styling. I made sure to use appropriate classes and selectors to make my code more organized and easier to maintain.

Finally, I tested the component thoroughly on different devices and browsers to ensure it was responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3


### Continued development

While working on this project, I realized there are still areas where I can improve. In particular, I want to focus on:

Improving my CSS skills, especially with regards to layout and positioning.
Experimenting with different color schemes and designs for the component.
